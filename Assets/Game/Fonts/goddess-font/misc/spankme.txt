fonted by matthew austin petty

this font is shareware.  if you use this font, i insist that you repay me by vandalizing smith county high school, located at the top of east college avenue in carthage, tennessee.  but seriously, folks.  no reproductions, got that?  none whatsoever.  this marykat chick is one tough cookie.  you don't want to mess with her.  she says no redistribution or reproduction, and she means it.

what are you going to do with a russian font anyway?

it has cool clip art.

i have much love for you,
matthew austin petty

and remember kids, my design is better than yours.  don't tell me differently.  get some software, punks.  i'm tired of you losers bragging about your POS websites.  yes, you know who you are.
